<h2>Use the tool</h2>
<p>place the initial credentials.json file into the local working directory
<p>use the get_gmail_credentials() function to trigger the login prompt
<p>sign in with the google account that you want to use - a token.json should be created

<p>make calls to the send_message() function for automated emailing
